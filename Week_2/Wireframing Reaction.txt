UX Design seems very detail oriented during the planning stage. The importance of early feedback and knowing your audience and your end goals is heavily discussed in the article, which tells me that the longest but most important process will come before the design itself. The designing stage itself is almost presented as the point where there is no turning back, since not having a clear vision in mind by that point will lead to aimless decisions that will likely be regretted far into the process. I believe the article is beneficial for UX design processes to remain efficient and well planned out.
